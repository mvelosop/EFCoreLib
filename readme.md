# EFCoreLib

This repo contains a very simple Entity Framework Core 1.1 console application, and Class Library created with Visual Studio 2017, to explore:

1. Separating client and database layers
1. Creating the initial migration using "Code First" strategy.
2. Creating the initial database.
3. Basic connection string configuration.
4. Using configuration classes with Fluent API similar to EF 6's way.

Hope this helps someone.
